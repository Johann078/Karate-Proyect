# Findings and conclusions of the exercise

## About Karate DSL
Karate DSL is a framework for API testing, performance testing, and UI automation. In this project, it was used to automate tests, likely for UI or API.

## Observed advantages
1. Simple syntax: Karate uses Gherkin, making tests easy to read and write.
2. Integration with JUnit 5: The use of @Karate.Test allows for easy integration with the Java testing ecosystem.
3. Flexibility: It can be used for both API and UI testing, allowing for a wide variety of test scenarios.
4. Automatic report generation: Karate automatically generates detailed HTML reports after test execution, facilitating result analysis.

## Challenges encountered
1. Learning curve: For developers unfamiliar with Gherkin or DSL, there may be an initial learning curve.
2. Debugging: Debugging Karate scripts can be more complex than debugging standard Java code.
3. Maintenance of feature files: As the project grows, maintaining and organizing multiple .feature files can become challenging.

## Possible improvements
1. Implement additional custom reports to complement the automatically generated HTML report by Karate.
2. Create a more robust folder structure to better organize .feature files as the project grows.
3. Explore the possibility of parallelizing tests to improve execution time.

## General conclusions
The use of Karate DSL in this project has proven effective for creating and executing automated tests. Its integration with JUnit 5, the ability to run tests directly from IntelliJ IDEA, and the automatic generation of detailed HTML reports significantly simplify the development and testing process. These reports provide a clear and detailed view of test results, facilitating problem identification and resolution. However, it's important to consider the learning curve and long-term maintenance challenges.

## Next steps
1. Explore advanced Karate features, such as report customization and test parallelization.
2. Consider creating a best practices guide for the team on how to write and maintain Karate tests, including how to effectively interpret and use the generated reports.
3. Investigate the possibility of integrating these tests into a continuous integration pipeline to further automate the testing process, including the generation and storage of historical reports.
