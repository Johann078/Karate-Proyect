# Project Execution Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Apache Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
   ```
   git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd [PROJECT_NAME]
   ```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA
   - Select "File" > "Open" and navigate to the project directory
   - Select the `pom.xml` file and choose "Open as Project"

3. Ensure IntelliJ IDEA is using Java 17
   - Go to "File" > "Project Structure"
   - In "Project Settings" > "Project", make sure "Project SDK" is set to Java 17

4. Update Maven dependencies
   - Open the Maven window (usually on the right side)
   - Click on the "Reload All Maven Projects" button

5. Run the project
   - Navigate to the `karateRunner` class in the project explorer
   - Right-click on the class and select "Run 'karateRunner'"

   Alternatively, you can use IntelliJ's run configuration:
   - Click on "Run" > "Edit Configurations"
   - Click on the "+" and select "JUnit"
   - Name the configuration (e.g., "Karate Tests")
   - In "Class", select the `karateRunner` class
   - Click on "Apply" and then "OK"
   - Now you can run this configuration from the main run menu

6. View the results
   - The test results will be displayed in the "Run" window at the bottom of IntelliJ IDEA

7. Access the detailed test report
   - After execution, Karate generates a detailed HTML report
   - In the output console, look for a line similar to:
     ```
     HTML report: (paste into browser to view) | Karate version: 1.5.0
     file:///C:/Users/[YOUR_USER]/OneDrive/Documents/Projects/karate3/karate-project/target/karate-reports/karate-summary.html
     ```
   - Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser to view the detailed report
   - The report includes information about all executed tests, including successes, failures, and statistics

## Additional Notes
- Make sure the `demoblaze.feature` file is in the correct directory (default is `src/test/resources`)
- If you encounter any issues during execution, verify that you're using Java 17 and that all dependencies have been downloaded correctly
- To run specific tests, you can modify the `testSample()` method in `karateRunner` to point to specific features or scenarios
- The HTML report generated by Karate is a powerful tool for analyzing test results. Be sure to review it after each execution to gain detailed insights into your test performance
